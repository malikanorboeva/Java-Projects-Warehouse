# Java-Projects-Warehouse
A Java-based simulation for warehouse management, implementing OOP principles and multi-threading.
This project simulates a warehouse management system, implementing object-oriented programming principles in Java. It covers foundational to advanced concepts such as pallet management, worker simulation, and multi-threading.

## Features
1. **Pallet Management**: 
   - Creation and management of various pallet types (liquid, solid, unit goods).
   - Calculations for weight, value, and placement constraints.

2. **Worker Simulation**:
   - Algorithms for worker roles (`Elf` and `Wichtel`) to handle inventory storage and retrieval.
   - Multi-threaded operations for concurrent worker processes.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Performance improvements for handling multiple workers and large inventories.

## Technologies
- Java
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Multi-threading

## Repository Structure
- `Aufgabe5`: Basic pallet and slot management.
- `Aufgabe6`: Extended pallet hierarchy and file input handling.
- `Aufgabe8`: Advanced simulation with worker behavior and optimization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Warehouse-Management-System.git
